# Anime Character Classification

A personal project to classify anime characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch. This Jupyter Notebook covers the full workflow of a deep learning project, including loading and exploring the dataset, defining a custom dataset class, splitting data into training and validation sets, building and training the CNN model, and evaluating its performance. The notebook also includes visualizations of training and validation loss to monitor learning progress and exercises to experiment with model improvements.
